* Introduction

*What?*Bukalapak*Bandung?*

Yes, Bukalapak had established a _Representative_Office_ in Bandung for a while.
One of the teams in the office is developing [[https://www.bukalapak.com/bukapengadaan][BukaPengadaan]], which is using Go.

*What?*Go*‚Äîa language developed by *Google*'s team‚Äîin a *Facebook* Developer Circles talk?

Well, even Facebook has several open source projects in Go üòÅ

* Microservices at a glance

It enables different tech stacks to be employed in a single application.

Just as [[https://www.bukalapak.com][Bukalapak]] stated in its [[https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies/bukalapak][Stack Overflow Jobs]] company page.

_Bukalapak_values_ *freedom*and*experimentation* _,_and_we_believe_there_are_no_silver_bullet_or_one-size-fits-all_in_terms_of_tech_stack._

_We_are_proudly_ *polyglot* _and_never_shy_away_from_trying_out_new_tech_or_stack._We_started_our_tech_with_ *Ruby* _,_and_we_have_now_spread_into_ *Golang,*Python,*Elixir*and*Node.js* _to_power_hundreds_of_our_microservices._

_The_key_culture_of_our_engineering_is_that_teams_are_ *free* _to_make_their_own_case_regarding_what_tech_they_choose_to_use_for_any_stories_they_are_working_on_with._

e.g. Notification Squad is given the freedom to decide their own teck stacks for their [[https://engineering.bukalapak.io/onsite-notification-service/][Onsite Notification Service]].

* Considering Go

* Considering Go

Just like the other teams, my team which is responsible for [[https://www.bukalapak.com/bukapengadaan][BukaPengadaan]] Service is also given the freedom to decide our own tech stacks.

We did it by using an *extremely*dumb* laundry-list comparison as an initial considerations. üôÉ

Then we dug down deeper to the nominees, *Rust* and *Go*.

* Considering Go

.image images/Final_Comparisons.png 570 _

* Expectations vs Reality

* What we expected

- Go is either an Object Oriented language or an Imperative language
- Database migration tools is reliable enough
- ORM support is reliable enough

* What we found out

- Go is a mix of Imperative, Object Oriented, and Functional language
- Database migration tools is cumbersome
- ORM library acts weirdly
- Endless refactoring, roughly almost 50% of our codes are refactored, even before the product went live
